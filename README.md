# rpd-puredata

PureData Toolkit for RPD-Framework

See http://github.com/shamansir/rpd for RPD Engine code, detailed information and docs.

This README will also be improved at some point, but for now this repo is just a
submodule for http://github.com/shamansir/rpd.

It can be used with compiled RPD engine as an independent toolkit, of course. (`Makefile` will build it, at some point).
